# DHSFD

## Introduction

DHSFD is a solution for dynamic functional dependency (FD) discovery. 
Given an instance of a relational schema and its current FDs, 
DHSFD efficiently computes the updated FDs when insertions and deletions are applied to this dataset.

## Reproduce Experiments

### Datasets

Our experiments use a host of real-life and synthetic datasets. 
All complete datasets are included in the [zip files](https://github.com/RangerShaw/DHSFD/tree/master/dataFiles/datasets).
